                <h1 style="color:rgb(218, 8, 8); margin-left:55px;">DS9 scripting using Python subprocesses<br></h1>
                <p style="margin-left:15px;" style="margin-right:25px;">
                    
                    I am currently working on star clusters and using whole GLIMPSE data, so, naturally I required three color images of a lot of
                    objects and from different infrared surveys (2MASS, WISE, Spizter). To do this one by one was one heck of a problem, especially
                    when you have 100s of sources. A good solution is go to IRSA website and download the images one by one but for how long?
                    An automated or at least semi-automated process is indeed required. I found a new pay to fetch the images by using a new python
                    module called pyESASky (link here) and this was introduced to me by Marcos Lopez (ESA/ESAC, Madrid) in the SciOPs conference on AI, 2022 held
                    at European Southern Observatory HQ in Garching. But the website is still a bit experimental and there is problem with minimum 
                    size of images which could be fetched and it certainly doesn't match my requirements. So, I decided to do this the traditional
                    way using IRSA servers to fetch fits files and use DS9 to make three color images. Umm.. the main problem still exists though.
                    But... anything can be scripted as long as you don't have to prove yourself "not as robot". Although, pyds9 exists, I could not
                    find an operational version (:/). So, I decided to combine python subprocesses and DS9 to automatically generate three color images.

                    The idea is to download all the fits files from IRSA by passing a list of coordinates and saving it. I'd suggest not to fetch more than
                    100 images at once as the website is a bit slow. After you have a zip file dowloaded to a folder, just unzip it and you'll see folders
                    with named ra+dec (ex. 293.711682+20.625794 or 293.711682+20.625794) and with raw fits images (ex. 2mass_j, 2mass_h, 2mass_k) with
                    systematic naming (a big shoutout to IRSA DB managers here). Now, let's get on point to run the python subprocesses to run DS9:





                    Code:

                <p style="margin-left:15px;" style="margin-right:25px;"> 
                    Having understood how these globular clusters work, let's jump in and see some hard to find and newer
                    globular cluster candiates, which are not detectable in visible wavelength but can be found in the 
                    Infrared light and find one more reason to love Infrared (IR) wavelength range. So, let's hop on to 
                    see some opaque, hidden globular cluster.
        



                </p>
                <h1 style="margin-left:25px;">UKS-1: Globular Cluster</h1>
                <p style="margin-left:15px;" style="margin-right:25px;"> 
                    UKS-1 is a pretty distant globular cluster and very redenned too i.e. far embedded in the Interstellar 
                    dust. This means in the lower wavelengths like optical it would be hard to find but with the higher
                    wavelength like in IR range we might be able to see something. Here we look at two pictures (data from
                    NASA Skyview), one from Digital Sky Survey 1 (DSS-1) (red and blue bands used) and other from Two Micron All
                    Sky Survey (2MASS) (JHK bands used). DSS-1 is an optical survey whereas 2MASS is a Near-Infrared survey.
                    Let's compare the two images of same globular cluster.




                </p>

                <p style="margin-left:15px;" style="margin-right:25px;">
                    The DSS-1 Optical Image is shown in <a href="#fig2"> fig 2</a> and the 2MASS NIR image is in 
                    <a href="#fig3"> fig 3</a>. It is clear the amout of dust extinction suffered is huge and the cluster cannot
                    be virtually detected in the Optical light. This again proves the robustness of IR Astronomy to dust and gages in the
                    Interstellar Medium (ISM) and gives us some amazing discoveries.
